/*
A publishing company deals with marketing of books and audio cassettes. 
For each book and the audio cassette the company needs to record a title 
and price of publication. Also a page count should be recorded for each 
book and a play-time in minutes should be recorded for each cassette.
Design a suitable class hierarchy. Write a menu driven program that 
instantiates the book and tape class, allows users to manipulate and display
the information about books and cassettes. The program should catch 
exceptions and if an exception is caught, it should replace all the values of 
data members with zeroes.
